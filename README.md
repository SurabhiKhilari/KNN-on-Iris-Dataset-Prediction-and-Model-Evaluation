# KNN-on-Iris-Dataset-Prediction-and-Model-Evaluation

K-Nearest Neighbor Classification algorithm for prediction and model's evaluation (classification accuracy) for the well known iris dataset.

It predicts which flower species does a given test input belong to.

It also gives the classification accuracy by using train/test split evaluation method
